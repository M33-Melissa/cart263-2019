Project 1: Sisyphus' Meeting
==============

Zeus had summoned Sisyphus to his office to discuss his punishment for trying to escape Death. Sisyphus is told that Zeus' office is on the last floor. Little did he know that his punishment (with a modern twist) was already in place. Trying to reach for his goal only makes it go further away. While being trapped forever in an elevator, he gets his happiness from seeing imagery of dank memes from the internet on every floor accompanied by relaxing elevator music. He has the choice of enjoying the ride or furiously click on the buttons to reach his goal which is actually meaningless because it is impossible.

Thinking about the story of Sisyphus, I had in mind to find everyday mundane tasks that feel like they take forever when you're in a hurry. I thought of a bus ride, or just trying to get out of bed in the morning. But then, while being late to class, I took the elevator and got irritated by the people who were taking it only to get off on the 2nd floor. A generic place with its little annoyances and patience-testing actions is the place where I got my idea for this project. However, the direction of my application takes those frustrating elements and turn them into fun and goal-reaching. An application where people will be tempted to just press buttons for the red glow and the pattern it makes, or trying to reach the highest number they can by just continuously clicking on the buttons.

As for the implementation of the code. I underestimated the scope of a complete elevator UI. There were too many functions I had tried to implement. Reaching for the real functionalities of an elevator was too complicated for the little knowledge that I have on jQuery. Therefore, I decided to go for simple implementations of selectable buttons and gradual incrementation of floors with a switch case that controls the images seen behind the doors.

This project was made using jQuery and jQuery UI for the buttons and animations. jQuery's selectable function was useful in this case for the elevator buttons while using a command that asks for the CTRL key to be activated without pressing on it, for multiple selections of buttons. The insertAfter function was useful for adding span buttons in the HTML. The animate function was used to open and close the elevator door on an interval with setInterval.

The variety of images that appear behind the door was found on archive.org, pngtree.com, Wikimedia Commons, unsplash.com, and others that were google search results. It combines into a mix of memes for comedy, office pictures to accompany the elevator setting, and a sprinkle of foreshadowing images of mountain landscapes and dwarves pushing on a rock in reference to the actual story of Sisyphus and his punishment of having to push a rock up a slippery mountain for eternity.
