Project 3: Moodify
==============

<div style="text-align: justify">
Moodify: Modify the Mood.
This application sets different kinds of moods with a sense of peacefulness. The goal was to evoke different feelings with its visuals, music, interactivity, and particle effects. The application gives off a vibe of live screensavers but gives the user different levels of interactions. On an overlaying layer, there is a dog with an important task: to wander aimlessly across the different sceneries. I've always felt like dogs were there to accompany people through their different emotive states.

Being able to generate aesthetically pleasing landscapes using particle effects.


Three libraries were used for this project: particles.js, jQuery, and Phaser 3. The different sceneries are made with JSON libraries containing settings which the particles.js reads and applies to the website. jQuery is used to facilitate the interactivity of the menu. Phaser 3 is used for the platformer game overlay. particlesJS has integrated interactivity where mouse hovers and clicks have different effects on the particles. Each setting was customized to fit the different moods.
