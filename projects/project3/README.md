Project 3: Moodify
==============

<div style="text-align: justify">
Moodify: Modify the Mood.</br>
This application sets different kinds of moods with a sense of peacefulness. The goal was to evoke different emotions with its visuals, music, interactivity, and particle effects. The application gives off a vibe of live screensavers but allows for different levels of interactions. On an overlaying layer, there is a dog with an important task: to wander aimlessly across the different sceneries. Dogs are good at keeping people company through their different emotive states which is why I chose a dog as a companion to the app. Therefore, being a bit obsessed with gradients, dogs, and particle effects, it was my goal to generate aesthetically pleasing landscapes.
Different video games music was chosen to accompany the themes. The original idea was to make it an ambient sidescroller, focusing on the journey rather than the game.
</br></br>Three libraries were used for this project: particles.js, jQuery, and Phaser 3. The different sceneries are made with JSON libraries containing settings which the particles.js reads and applies to the background. particlesJS has integrated interactivity where mouse hovers and clicks have different effects on the particles. Each setting was customized to fit the different moods. jQuery is used to facilitate the interactivity of the menu UI and sound. Phaser 3 is used for the platformer game overlay.
