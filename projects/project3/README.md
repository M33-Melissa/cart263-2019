Project 3: Moodify
==============

<div style="text-align: justify">
Moodify: Modify the Mood.</br>
This application sets different kinds of moods with a sense of peacefulness. The goal was to evoke different emotions with its visuals, music, interactivity, and particle effects. To me, the visual particularities associated with a season is often accompanied by specific emotions. Which is why the seasonal themes are associated with certain moods. The application also gives off a vibe of live screensavers but allows for different levels of interactions. On an overlaying layer, there is a dog with an important task: to wander aimlessly across the different sceneries. Dogs are good at keeping people company through their different emotive states which is why I chose a dog as a companion to the app. On the underlying layer is a scenery where the cursor represents you, with mouse hovers and clicks you can blow away leaves and petals, protect the dog from snow and rain, and show your companion the connections between the stars in the sky. As a result, being a bit obsessed with gradients, dogs, and particle effects, it was my goal to generate aesthetically pleasing landscapes with a doggo to accompany you through your emotional journey. </br>
Different video games music was chosen to accompany the themes. The original idea was to make it an ambient sidescroller, focusing on the journey rather than the game. Usually, sidescroller games have a sense of direction, a goal to reach. I wanted to experiment making a game without that kind of stress. I was thinking of adding collectables that contain small messages to encourage you through your day. However, I kinda enjoy the lack of goal of the current game. I also like that many different things can be added into this application. It has space for growth, such as adding more moods, interactions, and game elements.
</br></br>Three libraries were used for this project: particles.js, jQuery, and Phaser 3. The different sceneries are made with JSON libraries containing settings which the particles.js reads and applies to the background. particlesJS has integrated interactivity where mouse hovers and clicks have different effects on the particles. Each setting was customized to fit the different moods. jQuery is used to facilitate the interactivity of the menu UI and sound. Phaser 3 is used for the platformer game overlay.
