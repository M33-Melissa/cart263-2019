Project 2: Clickbait Thumbnail Generator
==============

The title of my project is pretty self-explanatory. It is a program that generates thumbnails using titles and company names given by either the user or randomly generated from JSON libraries. It puts a randomized and blurred image from Unsplash using the website Lorem Picsum. In addition to the mystery of the blurred image, there is a randomized red circle closing up on details from the image.

The JSON library for the title are misleading headlines.

The randomness is to ease the user to mindlessly click the buttons if they don't feel like thinking of a title and a company.

This program is made to generate "clickbait" thumbnails for YouTube videos (not exclusively).

The narrative of the situation would be that you are a YouTuber working with a certain company. Suddenly, you are told that they have cancelled their sponsorship. An alternative company is willing to work with you and their name is oddly similar to the previous one. However, you don't question it, since YouTube is a job and there is money to be earned.

This project was a challenge. I found it very difficult to find ideas to associate to the subject. Therefore, I ended up making something very closely related to the article, rather than indirectly referencing it.
